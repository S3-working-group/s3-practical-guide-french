# A Practical Guide for Evolving Agile and Resilient Organizations with Sociocracy 3.0 (French version)

This repository contains the source files for the French translation of the book _A Practical Guide for Evolving Agile and Resilient Organizations with Sociocracy 3.0_, currently available as 

* fast and mobile-friendly static html pages: <http://patterns.sociocracy30.org>
* ePub and PDF

German, Hebrew and French versions also exist and are also available via [sociocracy30.org/guide/](http://sociocracy30.org/guide/). If you want to help with translations into your language, please take a look at the [translations page](http://sociocracy30.org/translations/).

## Contribution Guidelines

This repository serves several main purposes:

- as a means of making all content available to people who want to build on it in simple and open file formats
- as a means of deploying the practical guide in its various forms
- as a means of making the text easily accessible for translations
- as a means of making changes to the practical guide transparent

The actual content of the practical guide is being developed outside of this repository by Lili David, James Priest and Bernhard Bockelbrink.

If you want to contribute towards the improvement of the Practical Guide, we have set up [a dedicated page](https://sociocracy30.org/ways-of-contributing-to-the-development-of-s3/ that explains how to notify us about typos and corrections, how to raise technical issues and how to suggest more significant updates to the content). 

Please note that we can't promise picking up github issues on a regular basis, and due to the nature of our development process, and we can't guarantee that we will accept any pull requests that include changes to the content of the Practical Guide.

## Project Structure

- `content`: all the files that are uploaded to Crowdin for translation (or downloaded from crowdin to the translated repositories)
- `global`: files that are identical across languages, mostly templates, including some with translatable content that is collected in content/translations.pot, because Crowdin does not play nice with these files. Also contains not language-specific configuration file
- `config`: language-specific configuration files: project.yaml, make-conf, LaTEX styles etc
- `release`: the latest releasable builds (must be copied there manually, all build scripts deliver their output to the project root)
- `tmp` the Temporary folder is autogenerated by  `build.sh` or with `make setup`


## Build Process

`build.sh` builds all available targets, you can also use `make <target>` to build individual target.

The build process relies on [mdtools](https://github.com/bboc/mdtools) to prepare and compile the individual files, and on Pandoc for ePub and LaTEX for PDF.

Before the first target can be built, you need to run `make setup`, and the before building the static site adding or removing source files or illustrations it's a good idea to run `make clean`.

To set up a new language, run `make clean` and then copy over `content`, `global`, `config` and all files in the project root except for `crowdin.yaml` and `upload-translations.sh`. Adapt `build.sh` so it only contains targets that are available in that language (e.g. deckset makes no sense for RTL languages).
<!--

-   add translated files from [S3 Practical Guide Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/sociocracy-30) 
-   check with English repository for changes to:
    -   `config/*`
    -  ` templates/*`
    -   `makefile` and `build.sh`
    -   the contents of all the subfolders inside docs (but not the file inside docs )
-    add translated illustrations to `img`
-   update version number in `config/project.yaml`
-   run buildscript (`source build.sh`) to build all formats or only build the website:
	-   `make clean` clan temporary files and web pages
	-   `make setup` to copy images and ensure all temp folders are created
	-   `make site` to build the website

## Known Issues

The ePub will benefit from polishing the stylesheet and setting some [metadata for iBooks](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#epub-metadata).
 
## Markdown Styleguide

Information in this section is preliminary, and needs further testing.

The Markdown files for the individual patterns are grouped in directories per patterns group and built using a build script. 

The following rules apply:

* MMd-transclusion  via {{filename}} is possible for all templates rendered via MMD 
* Markdown must conform to GitHub-flavored Markdown so that the Jekyll-version is feature complete 


## Translations

The content is translated in a [dedicated crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/sociocracy-30). The repository contains `crowdin.yaml` for use with the [crowdin CLI](https://support.crowdin.com/cli-tool/). 

Uploading sources is handled through this command (remove `--dryrun` to run):

`crowdin --identity ~/crowdin-s3-patterns.yaml --dryrun upload sources`

For each major revision we will create a branch with the version tag in crowdin, so future updates do not disrupt translation efforts:

`crowdin --identity ~/crowdin-s3-patterns.yaml upload sources -b {branch name} --dryrun`

The config file can be checked using 
`crowdin --identity ~/crowdin-s3-patterns.yaml lint`

 These commands assume [crowdin credentials](https://support.crowdin.com/configuration-file/#cli-2) in `~/crowdin-s3-patterns.yaml`
